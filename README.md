# tic-tac-toe-cpp

This is a **C++ implementation of the classic Connect 4 game**, enhanced with two unique features that add strategic depth to gameplay:

1. **Remove a Row** – Players can remove all counters from a single row. This can clear the path for future moves or disrupt an opponent’s strategy.
2. **Remove a Counter** – Players can remove a single counter from the board, allowing them to block a winning move or create a new opportunity.

These mechanics introduce a **new layer of strategy and unpredictability**, encouraging players to think dynamically and adapt to sudden changes during play. Limitations (such as using the abilities only once per game or under specific conditions) are implemented to maintain **balance and fairness**.
